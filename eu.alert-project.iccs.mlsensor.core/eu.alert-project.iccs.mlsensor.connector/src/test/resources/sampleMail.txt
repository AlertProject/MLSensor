Hi,

Yes, you could fork a previous version.
But IMO, it would be more simple to develop your own binding component.

Besides, the SOAP connector is quite big.
You may prefer start from a lighter connector and replace its logic by your own mapping between JSON and XML. Here is a suggestion of a not-so-old connector.

Instead of listening to HL7 (which are HTTP) connections, start a Jetty server and convert the received requests in Petals messages. That will be more simple than starting from the SOAP connector which has a Jetty but also Axis2...
