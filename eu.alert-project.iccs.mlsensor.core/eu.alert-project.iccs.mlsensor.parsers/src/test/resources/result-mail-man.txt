Like I said on #solid. I offer my help of the Solid project.

Note that I don't know anything yet about low-level system programming but
I'll learn with the time.

My area of interests are the hardware and network integration. Also maybe work
in collaboration with Plasma team.

At the risk of appearing blind...

I can't seem to find any source or documentation anywhere... I have found this
though:

"The APIs for working with and improving Solid will appear here as they become
available. First uploads of the API documentation to this website will likely
occur in Q2 2006 given the current roadmap. They will undoubtedly be
available sooner than that in KDE's subversion code repository where you are
welcome to track Solid development as it happens."

Has there been any public development of the API or is it still private at
this point? Will the solid repo be added to the kde4 branch?

Thanks,
Matt

Perfect! Just a suggestion, you might want to add this tidbit of knowledge to
your website when you get a chance. ;-)

Also, do you have a wiki in the works, or any plans to add one? With a project
as diverse and complex as this one will turn out to be, it might not be a bad
idea.

Sure, I don't expect everybody to master how to deal with the low-level
layers. Anyway we need people to write applications using Solid. In
particular small helper applications will be important. The first one being
surely the hardware browser that will help us as developers too. With the
current version of libkdehw it's even possible to experiment and write small
tools cloning lshal or hal-device-manager behavior (which are quite handy
tools).

You'll surely be interested in working on the future Plasma engine then. The
library is not ready yet to build this engine, but in the mean time, it'd
interesting to collect needs for Plasma applets. From here it'll be easier to
know which information should be available or not through this engine (some
of them might be overkill for applets).

To be honest I have no clear plan about kdepim/networkstatus, simply because I
didn't find time yet to look at it in details.

AFAIK, some parts could be reused but IIRC some of them are specific to some
PIM needs (please correct me if I'm wrong). If I'm not mistaken, that means
that it could partly migrate to kdelibs (where our main library will be) and
hopefully the remaining bits will be simpler to implement.

As I said for networkstatus my plans are not very clear yet (I'm currently
dealing with lower level stuff), but feel free to give me more information or
advices, it'll be very valuable IMHO.

Regards.

Currently the knowledge base is more or less in standby. I'd say we need at
least one person with strong knowledge in web application designing.

That said, I think that a small team of motivated people could design
something really interesting.

Currently I'd like to see some discussions about more detailed features we
could provide to the user, I've some ideas myself, but I guess we can come up
with more. Hm, that really show the need of a wiki again... I'll see with the
people hosting the website what can be done, I'll come back to the list when
we'll have something in place.

I think the web app could be developed separately from the wiki. The wiki
could be for things like documenting the API status and members, FAQs and
svn/build info, etc.

Please let us know if you can't get a wiki on the website where solid is
currently being hosted.. I'm sure somebody can come up with a wiki if
necessary.. ;-)

Subject: [Kde-hardware-devel] Core Libraries
Message-ID: <200601050841.23424.egaumer@pagecache.org>

What will be the underlying code that Solid will use to manipulate network
hardware?

The reason I ask is because I'm currently working on creating a library based
on iproute2. This would give applications the ability to perform direct
operations on network hardware.

My vision is a network daemon that unifies all aspects of network
configuration across desktops as well as distributions. This would eliminate
things like ifup/ifdown and even replace ip or ifconfig. The daemon would
also be able to store network profiles internally across reboots.

The actual daemon part comes into play by using the DBUS technology to push
network events (i.e., new 802.11 network discovered or cable unplugged,
etc...) out to applications that are "network aware".

My vision is similar to RedHat's NetworkManager project but goes beyond that
by providing a complete replacement for most, if not all, network start-up
scripts and providing a uniform mechanism for any Linux desktop to build
tools around.

My motivation is this; network management sucks on Linux. Sure if you like to
hack you can always ease the burden but users like mom are completeting left
hanging.

I was very happy to see this project come along and I definitely think it's a
step in the right direction.

There isn't a whole lot of information given it's infancy so I'm not sure what
the API will be built upon.

I'd be interested in getting involved. I can program C/C++ and Python. Most of
my work with the QT/KDE API has been with Python. I'd be more interested in
the core libraries.

Can anyone give some insight as to how the project plans to interact with
network hardware and wether or not something like libiproute2.so would be
helpful in achieving these goals?

I have a crude working library just as a proof of concept. The iproute code
uses some global variables that I'd need to clean up and I'd probably wrap
some of the functions to provide a more consice API. Eventually the ip
frontend would simply link to libiproute2 or disappear completely but the
option handling is messy as it stands. I'd consider implementing a finite
state machine to handle all the options available and provide a cleaner code
base.

Here is a simple example of using libiproute2 to list network device
information. The iproute2 code is built on top of Linux Netlink IP service
protocol - http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3549.html

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "utils.h"
#include "iproute.h"

struct rtnl_handle rth;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        preferred_family = AF_PACKET;
        _SL_ = oneline ? "\\" : "\n" ;

        if (rtnl_open(&rth, 0) < 0)
                exit(1);

        ipaddr_list_or_flush(0, NULL, 0);
        rtnl_close(&rth);
        return 0;
}

gaumer at debiantosh:(iproute-dev)$ gcc main.c -L./ -liproute2
gaumer at debiantosh:(iproute-dev)$ ./a.out
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue master if22052

5: sit0: <NOARP> mtu 1480 qdisc noop master if464320
    link/sit 0.0.0.0 brd 0.0.0.0


This is but a simple example. The library would support all features currently
supported by iproute2.

Well, I'd like something more focused... I tend to be lost each time I
approach wiki.kde.org. ;-)

Please be patient, we're in the process to get a wiki, it's just a matter of
time. I hope to get it going this week-end, or next week.

Currently the primary target is not fixed. The first backend will surely be
NetworkManager though, my only concern with it is that it's very limited...

Well, you're basically describing a NetworkManager on steroids. I'm not
against seeing something like this emerge, but why aren't you sharing with
them or trying to extend it in the first place?

Please note that I'm asking this to satisfy my curiosity, there's surely a lot
of reasons to start from scratch, but that would be sad to duplicate efforts
for the wrong reason. ;-)

Note that such a daemon would surely make my dreams come true (be it
networkmanager improved or something completely different).

Thank you.

I don't want to set a choice in stone, hence why the current design has a
frontend/backend split.
Since I'm currently focusing on hardware discovery, I provide a HAL backend,
but it's perfectly feasible to have another backend for a competing solution
or another platform. The backend just will have to provide the right
interfaces. Also note that those interfaces are far from decided yet
regarding network management, I'm clearly open to proposals in this area.

Of course it would surely be helpful. I tend to think that the lib itself
wouldn't be enough though. A lib+daemon combo like the one you described
above looks very interesting.

Just for further references, could you give us the necessary information to
download the code of your library?

In order to have the whole picture of your work. Do you have any plan for
dealing with ppp* connections, and VPN?

I think the PIM needs are for a large part representative of the needs of network oriented applications in general. At the time it was introduced into CVS it was added to kdepim in order to meet release dependencies (kdepim didn't want to rely on the latest kdelibs) but it is my understanding that it can move to kdelibs for KDE 4.0.

Will Stephenson should be able to comment.

NetworkManager seems to be built around libglib2 and I'm not sure how I feel
about that. It seems more geared toward GNOME APIs though I do realize it's
completely neutral.

In any event if you look at the backend of NetworkManager you'll see things
such as:

        /* Add default gateway */
        buf = g_strdup_printf ("/sbin/ip route add default dev %s", iface);
        nm_spawn_process (buf);
        g_free (buf);

So what I propose to do with libiproute2 fills a void that NetworkManager
doesn't address at this time.

It may very well be the case that I would eventually merge this work with that
of NetworkManager providing we agreed on the overall goal. If we fail to
agree then they could very well still use libiproute2 and head in their own
direction. It wouldn't negate the value of this core work.

The guys working on NetworkManger have more expertise in this area and so I
would certainly consider any advice they had to offer. I just see something
bigger than what their current design goal is (though they are similar in
many ways).

At any rate, I am but one person with limited time to offer so my immediate
short term goal is to get a library built from iproute that could possibly be
used in a number of applications.

I'm here on the KDE Hardware list because I've recently moved from Gnome to
KDE and think that KDE4 is going to be a major breakthrough on the desktop.
Being that I use KDE, I'm obviously interested in the direction it is
heading. Though I would like to see my efforts being enjoyed in a homogeneous
fashion, I would sleep better knowing it would benefit KDE and thus have
direct benefits on myself.

I think in order to move Linux forward we have to come up with this type of
solution. It's an ambitious but achievable goal in light of the open source
community.

I've read of a libkdehw but haven't seen any code. Is this anything of
substance at the moment? Is it meant to address the true core or is it an API
to provide an interface between KDE and some lower core? Possibly something
along the lines of libiproute2?

I only ask because if it's a true core than I would switch my focus to helping
that evolve. I have to imagine that something built from iproute2 code is
probably as low level as you'll see in user space. Building the library from
iproute is more of a reorganization of code. All that code is written and
maintained so my goal is to restructure the build process so that the 'ip'
frontend gets separated from the actual functions which would be used to
build a core library that 'ip' would merely link against.

This way those developers who already maintain iproute2 could continue to
maintain that project and I could shift to something at a higher level like
the Solid framework.

So it would seem that a library built from iproute would in fact be helpful
because one consideration has been the use of NetworkManager which would
obviously benefit from my work.

Wether NetworkManager morphs into something larger or something similar but
larger comes along, it seems the Solid framework would ultimately benefit.

Give me a week or so to get the build files written. Everything I've done has
been by hand up to this point (compiling, linking, etc...). Once I have
something that you can simply ./configure;make;make install I'll post the
code online.

As of now I simply build a standalone library but as I stated earlier, I would
rather restructure things inside of iproute so that it contains the core
library. I'm not too sure how those developers would feel about that but I
don't think it would disrupt them too much.

This stuff would sit inside the daemon layer and outside of libiproute2. There
is also the issue of DHCP which NetworkManager already uses dhcdbd to
somewhat address. Wether I would merge my ideas into NetworkManager or create
something entirely new, I would surely benefit from the work being done on
the NetworkManager project in areas such as this.

The library I speak of has a very direct goal; to provide an interface to the
functions that iproute2 offers. Anything outside of that would be addressed
in a lateral component and/or a higher level one.

I don't claim to have a complete solution but rather a general direction of
where I would like to end up. As things begin to surface and other developers
join in the work, a more complete and consice design goal would be declared.
As of now, it's just a embryo of a project living in my mind.

On my local copy on /branches/work/kdehw, I added admin directory to

to compile kdehw.

Since kdehw is a independent module will be in branches for a long time, I
think that's a good thing that we fetch admin directory.

As Waldo says, it's only in pim for organisational reasons.  The functionality
is not in any way pim specific.  We can move it to kdelibs when the time is
right.

To summarise what we have at the moment:

*) networkstatus is a kded module
*) it is a high level interface to network status information.  This means it
does not know anything about specific interfaces, wired/wireless, IP details.
*) it has 2 functions
*) - interface to find out "Is there a network?".  This works by polling kded
over DCOP, and via DCOP signals
*) - interface to asynchronously request a network connection (over DCOP), and
receive notification when the network is available.

Currently the interface is a bit more powerful than the implementations - we
envisaged being able to request "Give me a connection to host XYZ" so that if
a VPN or specific interface is required for that host, it can be started.
However, we don't have a network infrastructure that can do that yet.

The network provider that supports networkstatus at the moment is SUSE's
smpppd + kinternet system.

Feel free to ask if any of that is unclear.

Yes, in particular since on our side it would be accessed via the exposed DBUS
methods.

Indeed. That's a good reason to have such a project around.

Yes, it would benefit KDE. Solid is higher level, and tries to encapsulate the
underlying platform. But we build upon this underlying platform, so if it's
cleaner and more robust it'll make our work easier and we'll be able to
concentrate more directly on desktop applications needs. The more we cover
those needs the best future KDE applications will be. That's a "win-win"
situation IMHO.

This one will surely number 1 on the wiki. :-)
Ok, it's currently in the KDE subversion repository : branches/work/kdehw
Please note that currently it only addresses hardware discovery, there's no
code for network management yet.

> Is it meant to address the true core or is it an

It's an API to provide an interface between KDE and lower level facilities. So
possibly will be able to have a backend using libiproute2 directly, but it's
more likely that we'll communicate with a daemon over DBUS

Well, that really depends on your tastes. ;-)
But yes, Solid is higher level than your current work.

There's no doubt about this IMHO, that library will be helpful. I doubt that
we'll use it directly from Solid though. From what I know about
NetworkManager that would be a good move if it uses it.

Yes. Through the relevant backends.

Did you contact them about your plans? If not it would be wise to do it I
guess.

Which definitely means that your library alone wouldn't be enough for our
needs. On the other hand, having a daemon like NetworkManager using it is an
idea that pleases me.

I'm glad to know someone is trying to address this library need, in the end
it'll result in cleaner code for some tools (NetworkManager looking like a
natural client for such a work).

Ok, I should have been confused by the state machine. It looked oriented on
syncing features and as such looked a bit PIM oriented to me. Thanks to you
and Waldo for clarification.

Yes, so let's improve this infrastructure first thanks to Solid and from here
we'll be able to move networkstatus and make it aware of the extra
information provided by kdelibs itself.
It looks like a safe way to do it IMO, in particular since you're on board
having strong knowledge of networkstatus needs (as you might have noticed
that's not my case yet). And that's more or less how I plan to proceed with
the mediamanager.
Do you agree with this?

Subject: [Kde-hardware-devel] KDE (Linux hardware) issues
Message-ID: <200601072137.59440.sanderant@gmail.com>

Hi all, you asked for input so I thought I'd put in my 0.02$ as requested on
the announcement. I'd just like to put out a couple of ideas/questions on the
offhand chance you haven't thought of them (doubtful, but you never know). :)

1) The biggest problem with most of the hardware interaction issues with Linux
is that projects like HAL Device Manager is that they offer information, but
no way to rectify the problem. I know that Hal Device Manager was made that
way by design, but this makes it relatively useless, so the first issue is I
hope any type of device manager style applications provide a way to actually
change or rectify hardware problems as opposed to simply stating what the
system sees.
From my experience having to deal with that OS that runs on 90% of the worlds
computers everyday, the main use of a device manager style application is to
see if the OS sees the right hardware and to sometimes change drivers in the
case of mis-identification, or drop to a generic driver in the case of a
driver not working correctly.
This is my main shortcoming with Linux these days and would go a long way to
help those of us who try to evangelize and expand Linux's base.

2) What about integration with any existing projects? In particular I was
thinking about Ubuntu's hardware database and YaST. I know YaST is a whole
backend, but components like SAX2 are GPL and seem like they would go a long
way towards making X (which I assume would be a necessary prerequisite to KDE
on all platforms) easier to manage.

3) One more wish (which isn't done by any OS I know of) would be the ability
to show all the drivers the currently installed KDE system. This would help
for in the event of moving the hard drive to another system or switching out
hardware the ability to anticipate the difficulty of any change or when
making upgrade decisions.

4) Lastly, for those of us that don't have programming skills, but have access
to a wide array of hardware I would suggest you plan on releasing live CDs to
help us assist in any hardware information gathering as I'm sure you'll get
as much information as you can handle that way.

I realize these are generally pretty obvious, but I wanted to make sure I
offered them up for you since the project is just starting.

Thank you for addressing this weakness in KDE and I look forward to your
progress!

Sander

It seems that the first priority of solid should be informational.  The
device manager that you're describing would be better suited as a "helper
application."  Or a front end that is capable of accessing the knowledge
base and downloading and/or compiling drivers as needed.  This would be in
keeping with the tried and true *nix mantra of do one thing really well.  A
device manager would be an appropriate application to be released with
kde4.  It all depends on how ambitious we're willing to be.
I believe your second point is very valid.  Mostly as a courtesy to the user
more or less to update that system so it knows what's installed and what
isn't.  This again would be a priority of the device manager application.
I don't really understand what you're getting at in your third point.
Transferring hard drives to another system?
A live CD needs to be a future goal of the project.  I, however, see a very
limited use for it.  Most of what the knowledge base is all about is what
driver combination to use to get a device working "as advertised."  That
takes trial and error and usually some google'ing.  Most of my time spend
getting devices to work is not spent coding.  In fact, I don't believe my
coding knowledge really helps me at all.
Judging by the pace of previous KDE system development I feel that having
narrowly focused goals and sticking to them will make the biggest
contribution to KDE and foster the greatest amount of adoption.
Well that's what I think.  Feel free to disagree.

I'm assuming Hardware Browser will be something like HAL Device
Manager/KInfoCenter, I'm just arguing that it should be able to assist
in resolving hardware problems. Some help at least in figuring out
where the driver is coming from would be a start.

My biggest frustration with Linux is the complex nature of its various
hardware interfaces and how hard it can be to figure out where
problems are and how to resolve them. From what I've seen, on one
level, Linux is very much like Windows9x in its structure, I know it's
much different, in most but bare with me. :)

In both there is a kernel/base level that understands certain
hardware, and a monolithic GUI that understands other parts and in
some cases supersedes (or ignores) the settings of the original system
once it's launched.

Any help that would at least say where the information that any
hardware browser is getting would go a long way in making it more
useful. For example I'm typing this from a laptop with a wireless
PCMCIA card, but KInfoCenter reports "No PCMCIA controller detected"
obviously it's working, but something along the lines of
"/etc/pcmcia.conf reports no devices" or "no supported PCMCIA modules
in current kernel detected" would be much more helpful.

The laundry list of motherboard components and items like "math
coprocessor" are neat in screenshots, but as a practical matter are
useless since these devices will never fail independent of the larger
system and even if they do there little anyone can do to fix them.

> I don't really understand what you're getting at in your third point.
> Transferring hard drives to another system?

I apologize for being unclear. I was just wondering if there was a way
to query a kernel to see what modules are available and what hardware
they would support. This would be useful in scenarios where you have a
PC with a broken component and want to replace it with another to see
if a new Kernel is in order or not.

This is interesting. For me largely Linux hardware either "just works"
or doesn't. I can hack some simple configs like xorg and such, but
kernel modules are a mystery to me if they don't work initially I have
no clue as to how to resolve anything outside of recompiling the
kernel. I'm curious to see how linux's hardware handling will
progress.

For example I have an HP Pavillion ze4500, and by default the PCMCIA
locks up when used. I was fortunate enough to find an awesome webpage
http://emeitner.f2o.org/nx9005/ by someone much smarter than me who
figured out it was due to IRQs being misrouted and a change to
/etc/pcmcia/config.opts would make it work. Outside of this web page I
don't know how I would have resolved this problem, especially since
this problem causes the hardware to lock. I'm curious if any
initiatives like solid would help resolve problems like this.

I agree and KDE's focus on getting things done is why I use it as
opposed to super ambitious projects that are perpetually in beta. I'm
sure whatever you come up with will be a step up, and I hope some of
the distribution vendors help out since this is a clear difficiency
that keeps me from advocating Linux more.

One other note and that would be to solicit other KDE related projects
like KSynaptics and (very importantly for me) Lineak.

Thanks,

Sander

I had some time this weekend to get a functional package put together and
provide a preview of what libiproute2 can offer.

Several small examples are included. Anyone willing to help can gladly email
me.

Actually I would say it's quite opposite. It's much easier to locate problems
on Linux than on Windows.

I understand your point though and to most average users, they see Windows as
being much easier. The trick is to provide the average user with the same
abilities that Windows offers to setup and install hardware while still
retaining the flexible nature of Linux as seen from a developers standpoint.

Windows provides a standard ABI which some have argued should be the case in
Linux. Linus has stated numerous times that there will never be a kernel ABI
and so we have to design new ways of dealing with these types of issues. In
the end, the product is much more stable while admittedly more difficult for
the average user to work with. We don't want to sacrifice stability for ease
of use though and that philosophy introduces complexities.

You have to consider that Windows doesn't ship with most drivers. If you buy
some device it comes with drivers that the manufacturer specifically wrote
for that device and that operating system.

Linux is a different animal. Some vendors offer drivers but not all are open
sourced and so they taint things. Linux has the responsibility of writing and
packaging these drivers directly in the kernel.

On one side of things it makes setting up hardware easier because these
drivers are native to the operating system. On the other hand it's often hard
to keep up with all the hardware available these days. This is where
standards become important.

At any rate, it often appears to be simple task from the standpoint of the
average user. A "Windows does it so why can't Linux" type of outlook. It's
important to understand that there is a vast difference in the entire Linux
model. These problems can be addresses but it's not as easy as simply cloning
Windows behavior. Better hardware detection and support is going to come in
greatest volume by vendors complying to standards, understanding there is a
need, and working with kernel developers to produce quality open source
drivers.

A bit of a digression but I think this is often a thing that most users don't
understand.

As of 2.6.14 a new pcmcia infrastructure exists that uses the Utopia stack.
Utopia is providing a uniform model for dealing with hardware and so user
space applications now have a centralized means of communication with the
kernel hardware layer. I think the types of problems you described above are
quickly becoming a thing of the past.

What would you describe as the problem though? The fact that the IRQ conflict
existed, knowing how to change it, or knowing the conflict existed? On
Windows if this problem existed it would often show up in the device manager.
You would still have to search on line for a solution. I assume you would
like to have Linux somehow notify the user that a problem exists. I think
that's a reasonable request but it may be a little outside the scope of what
Solid is about. This would involve the kernel passing this information up to
the applications. That's an addressable problem but again, I don't think it's
within the scope of this project.

Message-ID: <ffa898c90601110303u1690bbf5r178366c924c4470@mail.gmail.com>

What would you all think of using a bitmask for device class identification
rather than using strings.  This would have the advantage of using bit
comparison (usually about 1-4 cpu cycles or O(1)) rather than using string
comparison (many cpu cycles per letter or O(x)).  If using an unsigned
integer this would allow us to have 16 different device classes but more
importantly have multiple device contexts such as storage and camera in the
same device.  The code would look something like:

FakeDevice *dev;

    // Initialise a fake system
    dev = fakeManager->newDevice( "/fake/doeseverything2000" );
    dev->addCapability(STORAGE_DEVICE | CAMERA_DEVICE | FLYING_MACHINE);

Any thoughts?

It's in the plan to move away from string based capabilities (you might have
noticed some "FIXME" in the comments ;-) ).

But from what you wrote it looks like you're proposing to use some
"#define" (note that I'm guessing here). It would be better to use an enum
type and an associated QFlags type. This way we'll be able to have the kind
of notation you introduced, but we'll also be able to make stricter type
checking.

Perhaps I should have put KDEHW:: in front of them.  I absolutely agree.  A
global (to KDEHW) would be fine.  It makes no difference in the code, except
for KDEHW::.  The only place where things get more hairy is when we get to
the subcapabilities.  If the device was only one type, a subtype bitmask
could have different meaning depending on the device.  This breaks down when
we have a device of more than one type.
One possible solution is to have a 16 wide array of subtype integers.  A
device with a bitmask of
if(this->DEVICE_TYPE & 2<<4)
{
    //device options are at this->OPTIONS[4]
    ...
}
One thing we need to decide is, are 16 device types and options enough or
should we go with 32?

OR . . . .

We could use the bitmask to identify what kind of devices are available and
have a **Device for arrays of *Devices, or QList<*Device> named things such
as:
QList<*Device> storage, camera, flying_machines;
Each one could then be a separate sub-class that inherits Device.

uint16 deviceDetected(QString dev, QString udi)
{
     //. . . determines it's a bluetooth phone with a storage device (for
pictures) and data functions
    storage.add( new Storage() );
    network.add(new BluetoothNetwork() );
}

DBUS is merely a transport (IPC) framework while HAL detects and stores actual
device information. HAL uses DBUS to pass device information it finds about
devices along to applications. DBUS alone cannot detect hardware. The two are
not competing technologies and operate in different layers of the Utopia
stack (i.e., udev, DBUS, HAL).

Udev initially creates the device, HAL appends and stores information about
the device, and DBUS pushes that information out to registered applications.
